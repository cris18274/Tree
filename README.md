# tree
#This code prompts the user for the height of the tree, and 
#then uses two for loops to print the tree to the console. The
#first for loop prints each row of the tree, and the second for 
#loop prints the blanks before each row. Finally, after printing
#the tree, two additional lines are printed to represent the 
#trunk of the tree.
#
#You can customise the tree by changing the characters used
#instead of asterisks for the branches, or add more details, 
#such as lights or ornaments, just let your imagination run 
#wild!
